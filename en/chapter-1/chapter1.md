Every book needs a first chapter, right?

This line was added in GitHub's editor.

This line was added in GitBook local editor with sync enabled \(manually pushed to GitHub\).

This line was added in GitBook locally, "published" to GitHub, and should \(hopefully\) appear in GitBook online automagically.

This line was added via GitHub's web editor. It seems to take a few minutes for the change to reach GitBook, so I'm going to time this one from commit to it showing on GitBook.

Less than 1 min 17 sec. Not bad.

Let's try adding an image locally thru the GitBook app:
